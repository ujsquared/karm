# Karm.nvim
a toDo plugin tool that stays around your workflow.

## What's the need?
just needed a toDo plugin that sticks around. Somehow needed to mimic my obisdian setup but make it more visible as I just dont see obsidian disrupting my workflow.
obsidian stays out of my eyesight, hence the work remains undone ;(


## How to use?
[WIP]

## Current Features
- just opens up a markdown file everytime I open up neovim


## Future features (Hopefully !) 
- make the name depend on the time and day etc.
- add an option to save and remove the toDo list from the stack, hence opening a new toDo list.
- add some GUI fixes.
- add modularity, that is allowing users to customise which direction the toDo pane opens.
